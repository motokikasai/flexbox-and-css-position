Let's create a list of the top 5 most popular programming languages according to the [Stack Overflowâ€™s annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#most-popular-technologies).

## Step 1

- [x] Create a list (using semantic HTML)
- [x] Order items from last to first via CSS (in the HTML order remain from first to last)
- [x] List items expand beyond their content, but not to the full width of the parent container

Take a look at the example:
![example](list-example-step-1.png)

## Step 2

- [x] Container remains centered on the page
- [x] Every other list item is aligned to the opposite edge of the container

Take a look at the example:
![example](list-example-step-2.png)
